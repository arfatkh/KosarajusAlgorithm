# Kosaraju Algorithm
 Implementation of Kosaraju's Algorithm to Find the Total No of SSCs and the  No of Nodes in the Largest SSC


## Course Project

The aim of the project to compute the size of Strongly Connected Component SCC in a given directed
graph. A strongly connected component is a partition of a directed graph in which there is a path from
each vertex to another vertex in the partition. This is applied only on **Directed graphs**.




##### **You will be using the dataset given at the links given below.**

1. https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Google.html
2. https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ego-Twitter.html

```
You will be calculating the SCC as per above algorithms and reporting the size of the largest SCC as
output. You can program the solution in any programming language you prefer. You will be submitting
the code of the project along with the screenshot obtained results and 3 min video discussing the code
along with the results.
```



**Constraints**

```
The following two functions must be programed by yourself and no ready-made library may be used for
these two functions. You must also share the link of the code resources that you have incorporated in
your project.

1. Depth First Search DFS
2. Computation of SCC

```
The description of various components such as DFS and rch is given below. Additionally, a brief summary
of the related project along with relevant theorems and propositions is available below.. These topics
are also discussed during the lectures.
